\subsection*{fmincon}
The function \verb|fmincon| obtains the minimum of constrained nonlinear optimization problems. The details of the function are described below. 
%\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}

\textit{where } \\ 
\verb|x| is the vector of decision variable, for example, the power generation $P_i$, \\
\verb|fval| is the vector containing minimized value of objective functions, for example, the minimum cost, \\
\verb|fun| is the objective function to be minimized, for example, this may be a MATLAB M-file for computation of generation cost, \\
\verb|x0| is the initial value of the decision variable, for example, the initial power generation vector,\\
\verb|A.x| $\leq$ \verb|b| is the set of inequality constraints,\\
\verb|Aeq.x=beq| is the set of equality constraints, for example, the power balance equation,\\
\verb|lb| and \verb|ub| are lower and upper values of decision variables, for example, the generator limits,\\
\verb|nonlcon| is the set of non-linear constraints,\\
\verb|options| can be utilized to provide optimization options, for example, it can be used to choose the optimization algorithm amongst `interior-point ', `trust-region-reflective', `sqp' and `active-set' algorithms.

\subsection*{fgoalattain}
The function \verb|fgoalattain| obtains solution by minimizing deviation from the defined goals of each of the objectives. A set of pareto-optimal solutions are obtained by assigning different weights to each of the objectives. The details of the \verb|fgoalattain| function are described below.
