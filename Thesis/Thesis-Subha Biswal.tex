It is always a pleasure to remind the fine people in the \textbf{Department of Electrical Engineering, Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology} for their sincere guidance I received to finish my Thesis. I would like to express my deepest gratitude and admiration to \textbf{Dr. Rajat Kanti Samal, Asst. Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering,} for his help and patience throughout this project. His excellent guidance, support and
invaluable assistance made my working and learning experience a very special one. This Thesis would not have been completed without his constant inspiration and encouragement.

I am immensely grateful to \textbf{Dr. (Ms.) Papia Ray , H.O.D, Department of Electrical Engineering,} for her support through the years and believe that the Thesis would not stand successful had not been for her. I express my gratitude to every faculty who helped shape the knowledge base that made the Thesis tale its present form.

In addition, I would like to thank my parents for their wise counsel, unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study. Finally, I thank to my friend, Ritusmita Dhal, without whose support It could not have possible to give a finish touch to this thesis and she also helped in reviewing and finding errors, as well as a happy distractions to rest my mind outside of my research.\\\\\\\\

\abstractrks{
\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{1em}}  % Add a gap in the Contents, for aesthetics
Any viable on-line dynamic security analysis (DSA) is intended to include fast contingency assessment . The usage of severity indices in the evaluation of contingencies is required, and for DSA, such an indicator must be a measurement of stability. In static security analysis, it is generally established that some indices outperform others for specific power systems, and that groupings of indices outperform a single indicator. Severity indices are more complex in DSA, which is still in its development, and only a handful have been tried for screening. Rather of sophisticated indices, this work proposes numerous simple indices for contingency screening.Again after disturbance has been addressed, these indicators are focused on coherency, transient energy conversion between kinetic and potential energy, dot products, and generator coupling parameters. One of the proposed indicators can detect inter-area stability issues using primarily two parameters: voltage magnitude change (decrease) and phase shift (separation). The most essential feature of this index is that it can be derived fast and readily from synchronously measured voltage without requiring system modelling or simulation, and it is not affected by network size. This research compares and contrasts different methods for detecting Out of Step (OOS) as an early indicator. On the IEEE 10-Bus Test System as well as other selected sample test systems, the analysis is performed using MAT-POWER and MATTRANS software in combination. Experiments indicated that these indications give a significantly earlier and more accurate identification of OOS, allowing for quick intervention to restore system stability.
